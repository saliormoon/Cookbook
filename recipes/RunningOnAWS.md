Now log in with your AWS Account or create a new one.

After that you should select the **1-Click Launch** tab and select the size of the instance (**EC2 Instance Type**) you wish to use.

Now you can continue with a click on **Accept Terms & Launch with 1-Click**.

**Note**: If you do not have a key pair a warning will appear after clicking and you will be asked to generate a key pair.

Now you can launch your ArangoDB instance in [your Software library][3]. Click on **Access Software** and you will see the ArangoDB Web Interface.
